<h2<b>Strings</b></h2>
<p>In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.
<br>
For example, the following code:
</br> <br>
var myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J"; 
</br>
<br>cannot change the value of myStr to "Job", because the contents of myStr cannot be altered.</br> <br>
Note that this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string, like this:</br>
var myStr = "Bob";
myStr = "Job";</p>

<h2>Arrays</h2>
<p>
	<br>Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely.</br>
	<br>Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes</br>
	<br>One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.</br>
	<br>var arr = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9],
  [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
];
arr[3]; // equals [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
arr[3][0]; // equals [10,11,12]
arr[3][0][1]; // equals 11</br>
